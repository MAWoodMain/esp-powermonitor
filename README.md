# ESP32-S2 Based Power Meter
This projects sets out to create a standalone power meter with 4 current channels and a voltage channel, this unit should be able to take measurement and publish calibrated values over MQTT to homeassistant and other applications.
This design will focus on having a smaller package and power consumption then similar RPI based solutions like my earlier designs. This design will also integrate a battery backup system to data can be captured during supply drop outs.
